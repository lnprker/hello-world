Learning how to create a repository

Hi humans! 
Calendars are useful. If you don't use them, you might miss your first Intro to Git and Github class, and then have to learn all this stuff on your own anyway. Upon creating my first repository, I'm now learning to commit changes on a separate branch. Thank you, Internet Gods.
Love,
lnprker
